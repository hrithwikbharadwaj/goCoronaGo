# Covid-19 Live Tracker India - http://gocorona19.herokuapp.com

It all started when the corona cases in India was reached 100+ and I thought its important people should know the exact number of cases in India.

Initially the data was scrapped from government sources but those websites took time to update so i switched to using one of the APIs built by
https://api.covid19india.org/

Built using Bootstrap,JS,Flask.
(This is currently not maintained. Sadly no one cares about these numbers anymore)
